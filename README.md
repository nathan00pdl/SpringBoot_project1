# About the Project 

This project was carried out during the [devsuperior](https://www.devsuperior.com.br/), java spring immersion, taught by professor **Nélio Alves**.

From my first contacts with **Java** language and its main characteristics, I became aware of **SpringBoot**, a tool that facilitates the development of java applications such as **web aplications** and **microsservices**.

This project was my first structured application with the framework, implementing **design patterns**, **connecting to the database** (I used the H2 database as a test) and making **HTTP requests** with **Postman**.  

Overall, this is a basic **gaming system** and its **descriptions**.

## Project Structure 
- **Layered architecture - MVC**
- Design pattern: **DAO** (Data Access Object)

## Backend
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot** 
- **JPA** + **Hibernate** implementation (data access with Object-Relational Mapping - **ORM**)
- **Maven** (dependency management)
  
## Connection to the Database 
- **JDBC** (SQL-based data access)
  
## Web requests
- **Postman** (testing requests with methods GET, PUT, POST e DELETE)
